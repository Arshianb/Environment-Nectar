### Goal!
:boom:To help our country's sweepers.
### How?
How do you feel when the sweepers of the city are exhausted in constantly collecting the garbage, when we can help them by giving our garbage location to them, so why not :smirk:. This app is made to give the location of municipal garbage to those whose job is :star2:. and this is even not only right thing to do :heavy_check_mark:, but you can also collect points to get discounts in the program sponsor stores :currency_exchange:. Its coded by `React Native` as you can see in **master branch**.
